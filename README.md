## Helps you get set up!

Stagehand helps you get your Dart projects set up and ready for the big show.
It is a Dart project scaffolding generator, inspired by tools like Web Starter
Kit and Yeoman.

## Stagehand templates
* `console-full` - A larger command-line application sample.
* `console-simple` - A simple command-line application.
* `package-simple` - A starting point for Dart libraries or applications.
* `server-appengine` - A simple App Engine application.
* `server-shelf` - A web server built using the shelf package.
* `web-angular` - A web app built using Angular 2.
* `web-polymer` - A web app built using polymer.dart.
* `web-simple` - An absolute bare-bones web app.

## Installation

Requirements:

To install:

```console
> pub global activate stagehand
```

To update, run activate again:

```console
> pub global activate stagehand
```

## Usage

Stagehand will generate a project skeleton into the current directory. As an
example, here is how you create a package with Stagehand:

```console

> stagehand package-simple
```

And to list all of the project templates:

```console
> stagehand
```

## Goals

* Opinionated and prescriptive; minimal to no options
* Mobile-first
* Support server and client apps

* Distributed as a pub package
