## Helps you get setup!

Stagehand helps you get your Dart projects set up and ready for the big show.
It is a Dart project scaffolding generator, inspired by tools like Web Starter
Kit and Yeoman.

## Stagehand templates

* `console-full` - A sample command-line application.
* `package-simple` - A starting point for Dart libraries or applications.
* `server-appengine` - A simple App Engine application.
* `server-shelf` - A web server built using the shelf package.
